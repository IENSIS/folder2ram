# folder2ram
a fork of fs2ram that aims to be simpler, faster, safer. 
Designed to be controlled manually for easy integration with other projects
debian source package only as fs2ram is a debian package and I stay mostly in debian environments.
for now I'm focusing on wheezy.

TODO:
remove weird folder compression
remove autostart after installation
remove configuration choices (so that by default it does nothing)
add optional periodic sync to disk
add optional remote sync
add optional custom/settable paths where the folders can be synced


TODO2:
make this work with systemd.
