# folder2ram

a fork of fs2ram that aims to be simpler, faster, safer. 

Designed to be controlled manually for easy integration with other projects

debian source package only as fs2ram is a debian package and I stay mostly in debian environments.

for now I'm focusing on wheezy.

NOTDONE:
translations in /debian/po weren't changed.

TODO:

check what is happening with """ inside /home/alby/folder2ram/lib/folder2ram/unmount-scripts/common.sh

remove weird folder compression

remove autostart after installation

remove configuration choices (so that by default it does nothing)

remove configuration cli GUI

add optional periodic sync to disk

add optional remote sync

add optional custom/settable paths where the folders can be synced


TODO2:

make this work with systemd.
