The manpage could explain the scripts, keep_file_structure etc.

I took the recent news of the Technical Committee's decision as a good
enough reason to finally try out systemd. I found that fs2ram wasn't
working correctly because systemd was unmounting everything
willy-nilly including stuff managed by fs2ram. I found the attached
unit file to solve my problem. I also made some attempt at
transferring the lsb header dependencies from the init script. The
/var/log/ seems to work, but could use more testing since this isn't
my typical use case.
