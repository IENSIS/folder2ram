## Information

See folder2ram manual (man folder2ram).

## How to

To use it, you need to :

  - Define the mountpoints that will be handled by folder2ram in '/etc/folder2ram/folder2ram.conf'.
    You can find an example at /usr/share/folder2ram/doc/examples

  - Adjust the pre-unmount scripts if needed. The default scripts are
    located in /usr/share/folder2ram/unmount-scripts.

## Inspiration

Some ideas were taken from the etckeeper package maintained by Joey Hess (how
to store the file permissions).

folder2ram is a fork of fs2ram.
