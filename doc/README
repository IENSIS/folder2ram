## Information

See folder2ram manual (man folder2ram).

## How to

To use it, you need to :

Define the mountpoints that will be handled by folder2ram in '/etc/folder2ram/folder2ram.conf'.
You can find an example at /usr/share/folder2ram/doc/examples

Adjust the pre-unmount scripts if needed. The default scripts are
located in /etc/folder2ram/unmount-scripts.

The default unmount scripts are in /lib/folder2ram/unmount-scripts/.
There are four different scripts
keep_content -- this script simply copies the data from the tmpfs to the disk before unmounting
keep_folder_structure -- this script keeps the same folder structure in ram, but no files are kept on reboot
keep_file_structure -- this script keeps the folder and file structure in ram, but files are fake and no change is kept on reboot (this is useful for lockfiles and other files where the only important thing is that they must exist)
compress_file_content -- EXPERIMENTAL this script saves the folder into a tgz archive. Theoretically should save space.
This is the equivalent of the original fs2ram's keep_file_content script.
Will probably become squashfs in ram if it makes some kind of performance difference in embedded devices.

## Inspiration

Some ideas were taken from the etckeeper package maintained by Joey Hess (how
to store the file permissions).

folder2ram is a fork of fs2ram.
