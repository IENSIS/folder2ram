# Short-Description:	Keeps folders in RAM
# Description: Moves the contents of user-defined folders to RAM during boot
#              and keeps it there until shutdown/reboot, when it
#              copies the contents back to permanent storage.

##### WARNING::::AUTOGENERATED::::INIT.SCRIPT::::BY::::FOLDER2RAM

# Version 1.0
# Author: Alberto Bursi <starshipeleven@hotmail.it>
#
# Slight modification of an init script called transientlog by Matteo Cortese <matteo_cortese@fastwebnet.it>
# Available from here www.debian-administration.org/article/661/A_transient_/var/log
# That page has been also saved and is available in the /doc/folder2ram folder for posterity.
#
# This modified version works with user-defined folders and is autogenerated by a configuration script, 
# while the original was hard-coded to /var/log.
# The file in the /doc/template folder contains heavier modifications so the folder2ram script can use it to
# write and deploy these initscripts automatically parsing its configuration file.
#
# transientlog borrows the base idea from ramlog by Jan Andrejkovic.
