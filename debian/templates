Template: fs2ram/main_install_type
Type: select
__Choices: Content-preserving, Structure-preserving, Unconfigured
Default: Content-preserving
_Description: Configuration for fs2ram:
 Please select the fs2ram configuration that best meets your needs.
 .
  * Content-preserving: /var/tmp, /var/cache, and /var/log will be in 
    RAM, reducing writes to the hard drive, and fs2ram will preserve the
    contents of these file systems across reboots.
  * Structure-preserving: /var/tmp, /var/cache, and /var/log will be in
    RAM, but fs2ram will only preserve their directory structures across
    reboots, not their (potentially private) contents.
  * Unconfigured: the fs2ram configuration file will be left empty and
    must be filled manually.
