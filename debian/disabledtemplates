#Default: Unconfigured
#_Description: Configuration for folder2ram:
# Please select the folder2ram configuration that best meets your needs.
# .
#  * Content-preserving: /var/tmp, /var/cache, and /var/log will be in 
#    RAM, reducing writes to the hard drive, and folder2ram will preserve the
#    contents of these file systems across reboots.
#  * Structure-preserving: /var/tmp, /var/cache, and /var/log will be in
#    RAM, but folder2ram will only preserve their directory structures across
#    reboots, not their (potentially private) contents.
#  * Unconfigured: the folder2ram configuration file will be left empty and
#    must be filled manually.
