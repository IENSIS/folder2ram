Description: move folders to ram and preseve contents across reboots
 folder2ram relocates and manages folders into tmpfs across reboots. 
 Each tmpfs mountpoint can be associated with a pre-mount script, 
 which is executed by folder2ram at each shutdown/reboot 
 before the file system is unmounted. The pre-unmount
 script must print a post-mount script on standard output, which is saved and
 then run at boot time after folder2ram mounts the corresponding file system.
 .
 This package provides two pre-unmount scripts designed to preserve folder
 structure and file permissions across reboots: this is needed to allow
 hierarchies such as /var/cache or /var/log to be mounted as tmpfs.
